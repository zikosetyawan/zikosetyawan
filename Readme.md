# Muhammad Ziko Ananda Setyawan  
**Data Analyst | Applied Data Scientist | Data Engineering Enthusiast**

👋 Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m **Muhammad Ziko Ananda Setyawan**, a Mathematics graduate with hands-on experience in **data analysis, applied machine learning, and analytical data pipelines**.  
I come from a **banking background**, which strongly shapes how I work with data: structured, accurate, and always tied to real business decisions.

My main interest lies in working across the data lifecycle — from **preparing and engineering data**, **analyzing patterns**, to **building predictive models and dashboards** that support decision-making.

## 🧭 How I Work With Data

I approach data problems through three connected layers:

### 📊 Data Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies  
- Translating raw data into **clear insights and business narratives**  
- Emphasis on data quality, interpretability, and reporting  

### 🤖 Data Science
- Building supervised and unsupervised machine learning models  
- Applying statistical thinking and proper evaluation metrics  
- Using models to **support prediction and decision-making**, not just experimentation  

### ⚙️ Data Engineering (Analytical-Oriented)
- Designing structured data workflows and pipelines  
- Working with databases, ETL processes, and scheduling tools  
- Ensuring data is **reliable, reproducible, and analysis-ready**
